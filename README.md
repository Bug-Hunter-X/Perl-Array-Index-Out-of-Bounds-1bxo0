This repository contains a Perl script demonstrating an array index out-of-bounds error and its solution.  The `bug.pl` file shows the erroneous code attempting to access an element beyond the array's bounds. The `bugSolution.pl` file presents a corrected version with proper error handling. This example highlights a common pitfall in array manipulation and encourages safe array access practices in Perl.
